# Election Audit

## Overview of Election Audit
The purpose of this project was to complete an election audit of a congressional election in Colorado. This included:

 Calculating the total number of votes each candidate received.
 Calculating the percentage of votes of each candidate.
 Determining the winner of the election.

At the county level 6.7% of the votes or 24,801 total votes were cast in Arapahoe; 10.5% of the votes or 38,855 total votes were cast in Jefferson; and 82.8% of the votes or 306,055 total were cast in Denver - making Denver the largest county by total votes cast. 

When it comes to the election itself Raymon Anthony Doane recieved 11,606 or 3.1% of the vote, Carles Casper Stockham recieved 85,213 or 23.0% of the vote, and Diana Degette won the election with 272,892 or 73.8% of the vote.

## Election Audit Summary
Should an election commission look to further analyse voting history (or even intention) based on demographics, geography, income level, or education. Should the data be collected this script can be easily adjusted to further analyze those characteristics.

To this end, should a future election commision look to try and predict trends or a potential political candidate look to predict outcomes, patterns such as percentage of voters at a certain income level who voted for a specific candidate could be valuable. Alternatively, should an election commission look to try and drive more lower income residents to the polls they could use these predictive trends to see where to best focus their resources.
